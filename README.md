CodeSurvey is a framework and tool to survey code repositories for
language feature usage, library usage, and more:

* Survey a specific set of repositories, or randomly sample
  repositories from services like GitHub
* Built-in support for analyzing Python code; extensible to support
  any language
* Write simple Python functions to define the code features you want
  to survey; record arbitrary details of feature occurrences
* Supports parallelizization of repository downloading and analysis
  across multiple processes
* Logging and progress tracking to monitor your survey as it runs
* Inspect the results as Python objects, or in an sqlite database


## Installation

```
pip install codesurvey
```


## Usage

The `CodeSurvey` class can easily be configured to run a survey, such
as to measure how often the `math` module is used in a random set of
recently updated Python repositories from GitHub:

```python
from codesurvey import CodeSurvey
from codesurvey.sources import GithubSampleSource
from codesurvey.analyzers.python import PythonAstAnalyzer
from codesurvey.analyzers.python.features import py_module_feature_finder

# Define a FeatureFinder to look for the `math` module in Python code
has_math = py_module_feature_finder('math', modules=['math'])

# Configure the survey
survey = CodeSurvey(
    db_filepath='math_survey.sqlite3',
    sources=[
        GithubSampleSource(language='python'),
    ],
    analyzers=[
        PythonAstAnalyzer(
            feature_finders=[
                has_math,
            ],
        ),
    ],
    max_workers=5,
)

# Run the survey on 10 repositories
survey.run(max_repos=10)

# Report on the results
repo_features = survey.get_repo_features(feature_names=['math'])
repo_count_with_math = sum([
    1 for repo_feature in repo_features if
    repo_feature.occurrence_count > 0
])
print(f'{repo_count_with_math} out of {len(repo_features)} repos use math')
```
